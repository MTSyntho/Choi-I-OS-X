# Choi-I-OS-X
Choi I OS X is a batch os that acts like a real os but isn't one. I will work on the files soon.
The name "Choi I" came from Giiiiiiing Ging on a YouTube Channel called "Nathan Doan Comedy" But the guy on the profile pic isn't Giiiiiiing Ging. The guy with that pyramid hat with a red band is Giiiiiiing Ging.
